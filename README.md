Customer Insights Analysis.

This repository showcases the Customer Insights Analysis project, completed as part of my training and internship at Internship Studio, where I gained hands-on experience with data analysis and visualization. The project involved working with two datasets: the first containing columns customer_id, trans_date, and tran_amount, and the second with customer_id and response. The primary tasks included merging these datasets on the common column customer_id, cleaning the data by removing duplicates, null values, NaNs, and outliers, and ensuring data consistency. After preprocessing, I formulated key questions to derive meaningful insights and wrote Python scripts to answer them. To further enhance understanding, I used libraries like Matplotlib to create visualizations that highlighted patterns and trends in the data. This project not only enhanced my technical skills in Python but also provided valuable experience in handling real-world datasets and solving analytical problems effectively.
